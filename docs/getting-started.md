## Introduction

This design system exists to allow future me (and anyone I work with) effortlessly implement any design research I've done. Too often, I spend dozens of hours on research and lose interest before applying it in any sort of productive way. The goal of this project is to ensure that I will be able to take advantage of the progress I make in spite of my fickle interest.

## What's going on here?

NP Design System is built with [Vue Design System](https://vueds.com). Vue Design System provides many more features than I can maintain, so this project, for the time being will be focused on the maintenance of tokens and elements that can be recycled throughout any of my projects, public or otherwise.

Now, since Vue Design System was built to handle much more extensive systems, the tooling I included is all I could ever hope for in terms of designing, documenting, and publishing versatile systems. The stars of the show, (besides [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) of course) are [Vue Styleguidist](https://github.com/vue-styleguidist/vue-styleguidist) and [Theo](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/theo), a product from Salesforce for abstracting Design Tokens.

## Getting Started

https://github.com/viljamis/vue-design-system/wiki/getting-started
This is the most important resource for getting started. I don't feel great about copy and pasting the docs, but I don't feel like writing out another version either, so this will have to do for now.

## V1.0.0 Release

Version 1 includes the basic building blocks of any website, as well as the _Design Principles_ that will guide this endeavor.

These basics are in the form of _tokens_ and include:

-   spacing
-   font size
-   color
