# Principles

Principles are the foundation of the system. They form the basis of a good product and help the team with decision making. They are here to guide you and your team when working with the myriad parts of the system and help you do better and more informed decisions.

The [Principles of Inclusive Web Design](https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/the-ten-principles-of-inclusive-web-design) by Sandi Wassmer was adopted as a first iteration of Principles for the NP Design System. We find that this system reflects New Perspectives' desire to create a more sympathetic world.

These are the 'prototype' principles.

### 1. Equitable

Be welcoming, don't discriminate and engage with people. Create different user experiences and make certain they have equally valuable outcomes.

### 2. Flexible

Provide options. Think who, how, why, what, where & when people will be using your website. Make sure there is choice for diverse users and maintain device independence.

### 3. Straightforward

Be obvious and not ambiguous. Make sure your website's features add value, not complexity. Remember, good design is as little design as possible.

### 4. Unassuming

Make sure your website's purpose is clear, and its content, structure and sequence are meaningful and convey information to all of the senses.

### 5. Informative

Make sure people know where they are on your website and provide different ways for them to find what they're looking for. Be timely, predictable, uncomplicated and precise.

### 6. Preventative

Provide easy to follow instructions and gently guide users in interacting with your website. Help them to minimise errors when submitting data, through well considered form design.

### 7. Tolerant

Handle errors respectfully and indicate precisely what the error is, where it is and how to fix it. Remember to let people know the outcome.

### 8. Effortless

Don't make demands or place restrictions on your users. People should not have to work or think hard to find what they want on your website. Ensure it can be used efficiently and effectively.

### 9. Accommodating

Be approachable, uncluttered and give people room to manoeuvre. Make sure that your website is unobtrusive and can be accessed by different devices of all shapes and sizes.

### 10. Consistent

Follow standards, guidelines, conventions and best practices. Provide a familiar environment with memorable functionality.

> Inclusive design is where innovation and imagination flourish. Meeting the needs of the widest variety of people does not inhibit creativity. It opens our minds and inspires excellence.
