These colors are adapted from [Atlassian's Design System](https://atlassian.design/guidelines/brand/color). It's a super fun color scheme and adheres to [AA standard contrast ratios](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#contrast-minimum.

An example syntax for each color token is `$color-Y100`. The code values (`Y100` in the example) can be found in the tables below.

Clicking a color will copy the hex code.
