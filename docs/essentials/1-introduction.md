# Introduction

(from readme)

This project is a guide to architecting CSS in an abstraction-focused way. The goal of this project is to provide developers a set of practices that will allow them to ensure that their CSS is built to allow for confident system-wide changes.

As it goes with methodologies, there are obviously cases where there's more value in going against best practices. The most beautiful systems often seem to be the ones that fit perfectly in to the environments they are built for.

Shipwright wholeheartedly embraces this mindset, and we aim to make it clear how each of the pieces in this system are connected so that developers can relax their worries that their customizations are breaking some piece of functionality. Resting developer's worries-a difficult endeavor for sure, but one we're happy to commit to.

there are two ways to figure out what's going on here. If you like to learn things by first looking directly at the source code, use index.html

if you like reading through the docs, keep going!





## Introduction

This design system exists to allow future me (and anyone I work with) effortlessly implement any design research I've done. Too often, I spend dozens of hours on research and lose interest before applying it in any sort of productive way. The goal of this project is to ensure that I will be able to take advantage of the progress I make in spite of my fickle interest.

## What's going on here?

This style guide is optimized for the *simplest* of use cases: styling a single html file. 

## Getting Started

https://github.com/viljamis/vue-design-system/wiki/getting-started
This is the most important resource for getting started. I don't feel great about copy and pasting the docs, but I don't feel like writing out another version either, so this will have to do for now.

## V0.1.0 Release

Version 1 includes the basic building blocks of any website, as well as the _Design Principles_ that will guide this endeavor.

These basics are in the form of _tokens_ and include:

-   spacing
-   font size
-   color
