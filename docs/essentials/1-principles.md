# Principles

Shipwright's set of principles is the least flexible portion of its philosophy. As CSS architects experiment with the file structure, code-base, and build process of our default set of [Materials](/materials/), they are encouraged to remain devoted to our underlying principles in order to maintain a flexbile and efficient design system.

### 1) Keep things simple.
It takes a lot of energy to build abstractions. In order to make it worthwhile, the abstraction should make things
easier in the long run--that's the whole point, after all. Shipwright is created to be simple to use in every step of
the web design process: setting up your project, protyping your styles, building your style guide,
implementing your decisions, and making changes with confidence.

### 2) Clarify your intentions.
Systems exist to ensure consistency, if nothing else. Inconsistent outcomes is the flag of a broken system. Shipwright strives to bring clarity to *where* and *when* design decisions are made and implemented so that
your system never gets in the way of your creativity.

### 3) Propogate decisions wisely.
The art of Shipwright is in deciding what decisions should be made, and how those decisions should be used. There's a huge amount of power in letting one decision cascade into many html elements and css properties. When it's done well,
the front-end work becomes an unbelievably frictionless experience. Done poorly, the engineer is forced to constantly
readjust design decisions on a case-by-case basis and is left wondering why they're even using a system in the first
place.
