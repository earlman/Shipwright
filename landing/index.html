                <h2>Principles</h2>
                <h4>1) Simplicity first</h4>
                <p>It takes a lot of energy to build abstractions. In order to make it worthwhile, the abstraction
                    should make things
                    easier in the long run--that's the whole point, after all. Shipwright is created to be simple to use
                    in every step of
                    the web design process: setting up your project, protyping your styles, building your style guide,
                    implementing your
                    decisions, and making changes with confidence.</p>
                <h4>2) Clarity breeds consistency</h4>
                <p>Systems exist to ensure consistency, if nothing else. Inconsistent outcomes is the flag of a broken
                    system. Shipwright
                    strives to bring clarity to *where* and *when* design decisions are made and implemented so that
                    your system never gets
                    in the way of your creativity.</p>
                <h4>3) Propogate Decisions wisely</h4>
                <p>The art of Shipwright is in deciding what decisions should be made, and how those decisions should be
                    used. There's a
                    huge amount of power in letting one decision cascade into many html elements and css properties.
                    When it's done well,
                    the front-end work becomes an unbelievably frictionless experience. Done poorly, the engineer is
                    forced to constantly
                    readjust design decisions on a case-by-case basis and is left wondering why they're even using a
                    system in the first
                    place.</p>
